    '''
    AF Meter of the Sennheiser EM 300/500 G3/G4 and EM 2000 receivers.

    The values we receive from the receiver are "percentages" with
    (according to the documentation) 0% == -50 dB and 100% == "peak".
    Greater than 100% is possible. And that's all they have to say.

    Now the transition between % and dB could probably be calculated
    easily, however unfortunately my mathematical skills are limited,
    and I couldn't "see" an easy way of doing it, hence the use of an
    interpreted lookup/mapping table below.
